This document serves as an explanation to the .csv file containing the data

This data set was originally donated to the UCL Machine Learning Repository in 1987
and containes 8124 different hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms. 
Each one can be identified as "definately edible", "definately poisonous" or "unknown edability". 
Mushrooms with unkown edibility are not recommended for eating, therefore have been combined with the definately poisonous category.
